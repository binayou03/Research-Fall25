# Conclusion

**Subquestion 1**: Do interest rate increases reduce outstanding credit card balances(debt service channel) or increase them(liquidity constraint channel)?

The local projection results show that a 1 percentage-point increase in the federal funds rate is followed by a statistically significant rise in revolving consumer credit at all horizons. It is observed that the coefficients(h) grow larger with longer horizons, suggesting a persistent and amplifying response of revolving credit to rate hikes. The strong statistical significance across all horizons (larger t_stat) supports the interpretation that households tend to increase borrowing, potentially reflecting liquidity-constraint behavior in response to higher interest rates.
  
However, during GFC and COVID-19, the local projection analysis reveals quite different results. During the GFC, the shock caused a small positive short-term effect (h = 1), dissipated in the medium term (h = 3-6), and turned strongly negative in the long run, suggesting that initial resilience eventually gave wat to substantial adverse outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the shock had no immediate effect, turned significantly negative at six months, and then largely subsided by one year, indicating temporary financial stress. 
	
The analysis highlights that the effects of federal funds rate are highly crisis-specific.
