**Subquestion 2** : Do higher interest rates lead to higher delinquency and charge-off rates, and if so, with what lag?

The overall result shows that changes in the federal fund rates have comparatively limited and statistically insignificant effects on both charge-off and delinquency rates in the States. When we examine the local projection, it indicates that a one percentage point increase in the federal funds rate is followed by a short-term rise in the delinquency rate and a decrease in the charge-off rate. However, this result isn’t statistically significant, as the 95% confidence interval includes zero. VAR and VARX shows that the delinquency rate and charge-off rates are also driven by their own values, reflecting strong persistence rather than a direct reflection of the monetary policy shocks. 

Even though some coefficient like the federal funds rate and charge-off rate are marginally significant, the Granger causality tests claims that there is no meaningful causal link between credit risk indicators and FFR at conventional levels. Additionally, macroeconomic variables in VARX shows that CPI and unemployment rates have significant but counterintuitive effects on delinquency rates. 

Overall, the results imply that monetary policy isn’t the only thing directly influences bank credit risk. Instead, credit performance is endogenously impacted depending on the past behavior or expended economic conditions. This suggests that policy meaures and default risk should add on to interest-rate policy with credit-market interventions and macroprudential.
