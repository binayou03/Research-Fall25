Core Question: How do changes in policy interest rates(Federal Funds Rate) and market rates(Prime Rate) affect US householdsâ€™ revolving consumer credit balance and credit card delinquency rates over short, medium, and longer horizons?

Sub-questions
Do interest rate increases reduce outstanding credit card balances(debt service channel) or increase them(liquidity constraint channel)?
Do higher interest rates lead to higher delinquency and charge-off rates, and if so, with what lag?
Which rate measure (policy rate vs. market rates) transmits faster to consumer borrowing behavior?
Has the interest rate-consumer credit relationship changed after structural breaks?, such as Global Financial Crisis in 2008 or COVID-19 pandemic?
Are the effects heterogeneous across group (low-income vs. high-income households, if microdata is available?)
Can ML models improve out-of-sample prediction of future revolving credit growth and delinquency, and which features (interest rates, unemployment, income, past credit behavior) drive those predictions?

Higher rates increase delinquency and charge-off rates, especially among lower-income households.
Market rates transmit more quickly to consumer credit outcomes than policy rates
